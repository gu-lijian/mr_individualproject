1. I added field ownHouseNumber in object Applicant, this field will be checked if applicant’s ownHouseNumber is 2 or higher then directly reject loan application.
2. This is a policy by government for loan application to avoid people to own too many houses and do property investment
3. This validation check is added in guided rule ”Validate Down Payment”, when section and also error message updated.
